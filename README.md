# relisp

Relisp is an [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)-package and minor-mode for refactoring Emacs-lisp code.

## Stability and status

Relisp is in development, and not ready for "production" use at this point.

You may clone the repo and load `relisp.el` if you feel curious, but there is no guarantees that things will work.
